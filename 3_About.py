    "Everyone can freely express his/her views and opinions anonymously and without the fear of consequences. Social media and online posting have made it even easier to post confidently and openly. These opinions have both pros and cons while providing the right feedback to reach the right person which can help fix the issue and sometimes a con when these get manipulated These opinions are regarded as valuable. This allows people with malicious intentions to easily make the system to give people the impression of genuineness and post opinions to promote their own product or to discredit the competitor products and services, without revealing identity of themselves or the organization they work for. Such people are called opinion spammers and these activities can be termed as opinion spamming. There are few different types of opinion spamming. One type is giving positive opinions to some products with intention to promote giving untrue or negative reviews to products to damage their reputation. Second type consists of advertisements with no opinions on product. There is lot of research work done in field of sentiment analysis and created models while using different sentiment analysis on data from various sources, but the primary focus is on the algorithms and not on actual fake review detection. One of many other research works by E. I. Elmurngi and A. Gherbi [1] used machine learning algorithms to classify the product reviews on Amazon.com dataset [2] including customer usage of the product and buying experiences. The use of Opinion Mining, a type of language processing to track the emotion and thought process of the people or users about a product which can in turn help research work.2 Opinion mining, which is also called sentiment analysis, involves building a system to collect and examine opinions about the product made in social media posts, comments, online product and service reviews or even tweets. Automated opinion mining uses machine learning, a component of artificial intelligence. An opinion mining system can be built using a software that can extract knowledge from dataset and incorporate some other data to improve its performance. One of the biggest applications of opinion mining is in the online and e-commerce reviews of consumer products, feedback and services. As these opinions are so helpful for both the user as well as the seller the e-commerce web sites suggest their customers to leave a feedback and review about their product or service they purchased. These reviews provide valuable information that is used by potential customers to know the opinions of previous or current users before they decide to purchase that product from that seller. Similarly, the seller or service providers use this information to identify any defects or problems users face with their products and to understand the competitive information to know the difference about their similar competitors’ products. There is a lot of scope of using opinion mining and many applications for different usages: Individual consumers: A consumer can also compare the summaries with competing products before taking a decision without missing out on any other better products available in the market. Businesses/Sellers: Opinion mining helps the sellers to reach their audience and understand their perception about the product as well as the competitors. Such reviews3 also help the sellers to understand the issues or defects so that they can improve later versions of their product. In today’s generation this way of encouraging the consumers to write a review about a product has become a good strategy for marketing their product through real audience’s voice. Such precious information has been spammed and manipulated. Out of many researches one fascinating research was done to identify the deceptive opinion spam [3].")
